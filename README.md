## Overview

The Custom Mob Plugin by SavageDev is a powerful tool for Minecraft server administrators to create custom mobs with unique health and damage attributes. With this plugin, you can enhance your server's gameplay by introducing customized mobs tailored to your server's theme or gameplay mechanics.

## Features

- **Customization**: Easily create custom mobs using the `/custommob` command.
- **Unique Attributes**: Specify health and damage attributes for each custom mob.
- **Flexibility**: Create mobs to fit your server's specific needs and themes.
- **Compatibility**: Currently compatible with spigot version 1.20.1
- **Note**: Damage is in health points (Half-Hearts), while health is in full hearts!

## Installation

To install the CustomMobs, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/Savagegamez227/CustomMobs/releases/) section of this GitHub repository.
2. Place the downloaded `.jar` file into your server's `plugins` folder.
3. Restart your server.

## Usage

To create a custom mob, use the following command:

```
/custommob [type] [name] [health] [damage]
```

Replace `[type]` with the type of mob you want to create (e.g., zombie, skeleton, creeper).
Replace `[name]` with the desired name for your custom mob.
Replace `[health]` with the desired health value for your custom mob.
Replace `[damage]` with the desired damage value for your custom mob, if applicable.

For example, to create a custom zombie named "CustomZombie" with 50 health and 10 damage, use the command:

```
/custommob zombie CustomZombie 50 10
```

## Examples

Here are some examples of using the `/custommob` command:

- Creating a custom skeleton named "EliteSkeleton" with 80 health and 15 damage:
  ```
  /custommob skeleton EliteSkeleton 80 15
  ```

- Creating a custom creeper named "SuperCreeper" with 100 health and 20 damage:
  ```
  /custommob creeper SuperCreeper 100 20
  ```
